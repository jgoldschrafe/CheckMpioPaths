CheckMpioPaths.vbs is a script to be used with NSClient++ that takes in a number
of paths and returns an error status if Windows MPIO sees less than that
number of paths to any of its multipath-aware storage.

Because it only queries storage registered with MPIO, it will not alert on local
disks which see only one path.
